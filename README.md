These scripts were used to create input files for the radiation transport code Serpent 2.0. It addition, some variables in Serpent needed to be iterated-over and therefore the re-compiling of the code was automated in these scripts also. 
These scripts were written in a hurry (and weren't intended for sharing) so they're messy. I'm putting them here as a reference, in case I need to automate Serpent runs in future.
